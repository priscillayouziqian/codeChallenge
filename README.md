# codeChallenge

Everyday coding challenge for JavaScript. This is me [below GIFs] when I try to solve a coding challenge at the **beginning.** But when I keep pushing it, I am addicted to it surprisingly.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript

Complete a coding challenge in JavaScript to show how I solve it or debug, comment attached with thoughts and steps.

## Lessons Learned:

I start from the easiest level-8Kyu, and I try to keep posting at least one challenge every single day in this repository. Sometimes I can't solve it, but I still post it anyway with my thoughts in the comments. I try my best to push **EVERY DAY. Persistence is a key ingredient to success.**
